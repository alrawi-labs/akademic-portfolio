    "longDescription": "Modern Portfolio is a multilingual and scalable portfolio infrastructure designed to enable developers to professionally showcase their projects, skills, and technical expertise.\n\nThe project is not merely a visual showcase; it is the result of a well-structured architectural decision process. Built using the Next.js App Router architecture, it delivers a fast, SEO-optimized, and performance-oriented system. Thanks to its dynamic routing structure, projects can be managed through dedicated detail pages.\n\nWith internationalization (i18n) support, content is organized within a multilingual structure. All text content can be centrally managed, and new languages can be seamlessly integrated into the system.\n\nThrough its modular component architecture, each section can be independently developed and reused. This approach ensures the project remains sustainable for both personal use and productization (such as selling it as a template).\n\nOn the design side, minimalism, balanced typography, and smooth animations are prioritized. The objective is to deliver a clean, professional, and trust-inspiring experience for visitors.",

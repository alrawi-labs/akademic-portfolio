      "content": "In an era where user-generated content is increasing, maintaining a safe and respectful online environment is becoming increasingly challenging. NoBadWords was developed to meet this critical need by offering an intelligent moderation system that understands context to protect platforms from toxic and inappropriate content.\n\nThe project began with a simple yet powerful vision: to create a content filtering system that not only matches words from a blacklist but truly understands context and intent. Many existing solutions fail to distinguish legitimate word usage from toxic behavior, resulting in either over-filtering (false positives) or under-filtering (false negatives).\n\nWhat makes NoBadWords unique is its hybrid approach that combines AI-powered context analysis with comprehensive toxic word databases. Moreover, it provides full support for languages often overlooked by Western-centered moderation tools, such as Arabic and Turkish."

Theme preference (dark or light mode), browser language, and environmental data are collected at this stage.\n\nAfter the page loads, the user is asked to accept cookies. Upon cookie consent, the device's fingerprint data is processed for security purposes. This data is securely hashed before processing and used as a unique key for each user.\n\nEven if the user has not yet created an account, the system automatically generates an anonymous base account in the background. When the user later registers or opens new accounts, these accounts are linked to the same unique hash key to verify that they belong to the same person.\n\nThis mechanism allows a user to create a maximum of 7 accounts on the platform. This structure not only enhances security but also lays the foundation for advanced usage scenarios that will be explained later."
